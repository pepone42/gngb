Prerequisites :

You need a recent version of SDL (I use SDL-1.2). 
The 1.0 serie don't work, sorry.

Installation : 
./configure
make
make install

if you want to compile with a debuger

./configure --with-debuger=yes
make
make install

Save/Load state change sine last version certainly old save don't work 

Use :

gngb [option] game 
option:
-h            : show this help
-a            : auto frame skip
-G            : force normal gameboy
-S            : force to super gameboy
-C            : force to color gameboy
-f            : fullscreen
-j joy_num    : use joy_num as joystick 
-s            : sound on
-r            : rumble on
-o            : opengl renderer
-O WxH        : same as o, but with WxH resolution (instead of double size)
-y            : use constant cycle (cycle don't change according to nb sprite
on a line)
-g            : try to emulate gdma cycle
-Y            : YUV Mode (resizable)

Key :

Enter          : Start
Right Shift    : Select
W              : B       (on azerty kerboard)
X              : A    

F9             : fullscreen on/off
Shift + F(1-8) : save state (experimental) 
F(1-8)         : load state (experimental)
F10            : show fps (work only with -a options)
F11            : reset
F12            : show key code
